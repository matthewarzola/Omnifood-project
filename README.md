## Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 — Jonas Schmedtmann

This repository contains my work from **Jonas Schmedtmann’s Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3** course on Udemy. The course provides a clear and practical introduction to modern HTML5 and CSS3, guiding you through the process of building a complete website from scratch.

Throughout the course, every step is explained in detail, making it easy to understand how each feature works and why it’s implemented. The project itself is a fictional food-delivery website, designed to teach the essential building blocks of a responsive, real-world layout — without unnecessary complexity.
